            <p>When the Weeknd—aka Abel Tesfaye—first arrived, he shrouded himself in mystery. He rarely showed his face and never spoke outside the music that peppered his 2011 mixtape trilogy, House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence. But that changed when Drake’s cosign led to his major-label debut, Kiss Land, in 2013. His follow-up, Beauty Behind the Madness, made him a star with singles like “Earned It,” “Can’t Feel My Face,” and “The Hills.” His third album, Starboy, with its title track appearance from Daft Punk, cemented his status as one of the most visible pop stars in the world.</p>
